            <h3>Here's a time line of Socrates main aphorisms:</h3>  
            <ul>
              <li>"The unexamined life is not worth living."</li>
              <li>"The only good is knowledge and the only evil is ignorance."</li>
              <li>"Think not those faithful who praise all thy words and actions; but those who kindly reprove thy faults."</li>
             <li>"If a man is proud of his wealth, he should not be praised until it is known how he employs it."</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Socrates is famous for his personal phylosophic method:</h3>
            <p>it is called maieutics, method of elenchus, elenctic method, or Socratic debate, is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presumptions. It is a dialectical method, often involving a discussion in which the defense of one point of view is questioned; one participant may lead another to contradict themselves in some way, thus weakening the defender's point. This method is named after the classical Greek philosopher Socrates and is introduced by him in Plato's Theaetetus as midwifery (maieutics) because it is employed to bring out definitions implicit in the interlocutors' beliefs, or to help them further their understanding.
  The Socratic method is a method of hypothesis elimination, in that better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to contradictions. The Socratic method searches for general, commonly held truths that shape beliefs and scrutinizes them to determine their consistency with other beliefs.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>"Having been accused by the Athenian government of impiety and of corrupting young people with his teachings, the philosopher Socrates was tried, found guilty, and offered the choice of renouncing his beliefs or drinking the cup of hemlock. He died willingly for the principles he held dear.
